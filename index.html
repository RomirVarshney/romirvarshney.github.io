								<span class="image main" title = "Photoshoot from an abandoned building."><img src="images/abandonedBuilding.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am a self-driven and motivated 17-year-old Indian-American Senior currently attending Stanton College Preparatory High School, and enrolled in the <a href = "https://www.ibo.org/"> International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme </a>, in Jacksonville, Florida.
								Through my studies and experiences, I have become proficient in numerous programming languages while also gaining experience in both Front-End and Back-End development. I've created and worked multiple <a href="#myWork" style="color:lightpink" title = "Click here to see my works!">projects</a>. showcasing both in various programming languages.</p>
								<p>In my free time, I actively participate in the cultural world around me, volunteering for various different projects and organizations, even performing on stage in front of large crowds. I love tinkering with hardware, listening to (and creating!) music, and playing all types of sports (Go Jags!).
								My ultimate goal is to work at a company that I feel utilizes my skillset in the best way possible, while also actively working to improve society and its foundations, both short-term and long-term.</p>

								<p>Utilized Java and GUI from Eclipse, to create a <a href="https://github.com/RomirVarshney/IB-Dossier" title="IB Dossier"> project </a> for my IB Computer Science A class in my junior year. GUI Program utilizes a variety of complexity components, including different classes/screens, file i/o, etc. to produce a program that is capable of storing, sorting, and deleting users, withdrawing and depositing money, viewing users, and while also changing the program currency into four different ones. Took over 3 months to fully plan, design, program, test, and evaluate final product before submitting.

Picture contains a sun, clouds, a bird, and a road as well as the 5 buildings. Image pulled from www.easy2dart.com, and was initially created in my freshman year through QBASIC. I then recreated the same picture in my junior year in Java. The Java program contains over 700 lines of code utilizing line commands, block commands, color, and circular and elliptical code in objects like the sun and the bird. Comments made throughout the program to help organize the code and make it easier to read and follow through. These projects were each completed in about a month, in class periods of 90 minutes, which occurred every other school day.
