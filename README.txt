This is my personal website, designed entirely through HTML, utilizing the HTML5 UP template. This website includes my resume, a page showcasing my projects and work, a music page showcasing some music that I've made, and an "About Me" page. This website also contains many icons, hyperlinks, music players and other widgets, all contributing to a sleek and minimal website design. Overall, this website conveys much about myself, and allowed me to hone my front-end programming skills.
